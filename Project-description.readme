# Taskflow: A Fullstack Task Manager (MERN)

## Overview
Taskflow is a cloud-based task management web application designed to streamline team collaboration and task organization. Built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js), Taskflow offers an intuitive interface for efficient task assignment, tracking, and communication. This platform is tailored for both administrators and regular users, providing a comprehensive suite of features to enhance productivity and coordination.
